This is my larger project for the other class, that also meets the badges.

Ch11 Sounds play when you jump and shoot. It uses an audio source and the audio clips in the audio folder.

Ch12 The game manger in the game scene stays loaded even when the scene is unloaded and persists between scene changes using this code 
private void Awake() 
{instance = this; 
DontDestroyOnLoad(this)}

Wk13 There are 2 scriptible objects. 1 being the game data which stores what checkpoint the player is at and how much time they have played. And the Checkpoint manager which keeps track of what checkpoints there are and what scene they are in.
